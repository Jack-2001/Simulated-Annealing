# Simulated-Annealing
Summer Research Internship

Simulated annealing is a well-renowned metaheuristic algorithm employed to address the black box
optimization problems related to searching for global
optimums. This paper explores the technique of Simulated
Annealing and aims to study its extended applications in
the field of communication design and network synthesis.
